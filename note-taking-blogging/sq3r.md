# SQ3R

To gain more understanding when reading an article or any non-fiction, apply this method. It can be applied at many levels \(for exemple, in a book, it can be applied once on the book itself, to gain a flow of how the book will feel, and then on each chapter\).

## Scan

Go over the contet, don't read anything. Skim over images, titles, anything that catch the eyes. **Don't read!**  You're just trying to get what the article/book/etc.. is about. How it flows, where it is trying to go and how.

What to check:

* Images
* Titles
* Comments to catch the eye
* Index
* Charts

## Question

After scanning, note all the questions that come to mind. What you hope the article will help you with. What you could do with it. The problems you already see.

## Read / Recurse

If you did it on an entire book, recurse. Go to a chapter and begin scanning it.

Else, begin to read. try to read in a way that will be rapid, but allow you to answer any question you have. As you read, -&gt;

## Record

While you read, record the answers to your questions. Add new questions. Add interesting stuff. Note stuff that don't make sense.

After reading, note what you feel about the lecture you had, how you feel you understood it.

## Review

And take a time to review. One week after, one month after. Don't just read it, quizz yourself. Try to answer your question without looking. Add note if you undertood new things.
